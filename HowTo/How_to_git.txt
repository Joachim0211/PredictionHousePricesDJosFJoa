pwd #shows the current directory
cd .. # moves one level up
cd directory #moves into the respective directory

# if you are where you want to be

#git commands: clone the project on your computer:
git clone https://github.com/Joachim0211/GansProjectG3.git

#cd into the new folder 'GansProjectG3'
cd GansProjectG3

#check the git status
git status

# now you can work here on the files

#when finished:
git pull #allways pull before push to main
git status  # shows whether you have something to commit (changed)
git add . # add the changes to the commit, donÂ´t forget the .
git status # now the commit is ready the changed files should be in green
git commit -m "a short comment on what you have done e.g. I did delete lin 5-10" #commit your changes locally

git push origin main #!!!! this should normally not be done if you are working in a group 
			# it changes the respective file in main of the githup repository, imagine all four
			# are working on the same file and do this. only the last file would stay all other 
			# were overwritten and only recoverable from you local repo

#so if we start to work on one file do the following:
#first pull the current status to your local main:
git pull 

# now make a local new branch
git switch -c nameOfTheNewBrach
#in you command line you should see the new branch indicated

git push --set-upstream origin nameOfTheNewBranch # this pushes it to a new branch on githup  
# you have set up the branch on git hup today
