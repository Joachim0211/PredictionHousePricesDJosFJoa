This short file will show the steps to put API-Keys and other sensible data in a .env file in order not
to push it on Githup.
The .env is in the gitignore-file, what means, the file is not included in any push to githup!

The prozess includes some steps but is solid.

run in yor notebook the following lines: 

!pip install python-dotenv
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv
import os

You do need to do the installation probably only once!

Now make a file: .env  in the same! folder as your notebook is in.

The following steps need to be done on the command line or at least 
I only know how to do it from there.

First go to the folder with you notebook and the .env file. 
Type in: 
ls -a #you should see the .env file
open the file with nano (or any othe text editor):
Type in:
nano .env 	# opens the file, the file should be empty
		# write in the file e.g.: API_K_W='d0040c9b033d6a3a4772784afd988afa'
now:
strg + o # saves the files after you enter
strg + x # exits nano back to the command line

now leave the command line:
in your notebook (same folder as .env) 
type in :
API_key = os.getenv("API_K_W")# now API_key contains your key

Now you can push your notebook to githup and anybody who wants to use it must use his own key!!

Good luck Joachim
